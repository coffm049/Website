# About Me  
I am a 3rd year Biostatistics PhD at the University of Minnesota. I am born and raised in Duluth, MN where I have grown to love the cold weather. I enjoy playing ice hockey, skiing of all sorts, and have recently decided to learn to swim well enough to train for triathlons and my first Ironman! In my free time I like to play music, hang with my family, and work on my house.
