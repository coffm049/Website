title: Hosting friendsgiving 
---

- In post-pandemic life, people not socializing in person as often
- Even our friend group which has been from basically the beginning of middle school hasn't been as much
- On top of that it seems that most people are channeling that energy in to working at home extra hard 
- My wife and I decided to host friendsgiving to reconnenct
- The response was amazing people had toons of fun and laughtetr and games for a full 5 hours 
- I also am practicing more personal contact and hugging to initiate the brain releasing dopamine
